# ADD-ML
Automotive metallurgy defect sensing pipeline

## Installation
Simply `git clone` this repository to your machine, and open `main.ipynb` in a compatible editor. Ensure you have Python 3.12 or higher installed, alongside any respective libraries using `pip`. *I recommend running this notebook in SageMaker or Colab.*

The dataset used for this project was [AutoVI](https://autovi.utc.fr/), courtesy of Université de technologie de Compiègne and the Renault Group. Unzip the data to the same directory the Jupyter notebook is located. If a different dataset is required, ensure it conforms to the schema provided in the data preprocessing section of the notebook.

Once the dataset has been provided and the Juptyer notebook started, the pipeline will automatically run through its entirety.
